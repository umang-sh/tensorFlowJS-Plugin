# tensorFlowJS-Plugin
TensorFlow JS plugin for IntelliJ , gives ability to code tensorFlow JS in IntelliJ .

Unfortunately it turns out in the IntelliJ Ultimate , the features for tensorFlow JS works the moment you do npm install tensorflow-js
So this plugin isnt required anymore :( 

This plugin works on IntelliJ ultimate and Community edition and the parser ,lexer AST logic all were written manually by me.

It supports all the Javascript syntaxes (ECMA Script 6+) 

Since I have stopped working on it , wont be able to provide any support
